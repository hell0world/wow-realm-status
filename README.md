WOW Realm Status
================

This is Edwin who works as a developer at http://www.wow-goldstore.com/. I want to build a class to retrive 
the status from the official realm page http://us.battle.net/wow/en/status.

It's my first project on github. I need to learn a bit about the system.

I have found some similar project around the internet. But most of them are really old without the updating 
in the last 2-5 years. For example: http://www.ac-web.org/forums/showthread.php?82924-Release-Realm-status-PHP-script-2-0.

It will be a wordpress plugin, as the CMS is my favriote. Simply adding the short-code into the page/post of your blog, then you will be able to get the list of the status included the realm name, server type, status and country. You are able to get the joomlar version 
https://code.google.com/p/wow-realmstatus-module/.

= 1.0.0 =
* First released version - coming soon!
